It's in working state atm

Can be run from any server/computer that have access remotely to Netbox with API key (you need to fill up the var.ini)

Work with more recent version of Netbox (Tested with Netbox 4.3.4 and Python 3.13.5)

Packages (pynetbox==7.5.0)

You just need to run the main.py and everything is done in correct order.

You can follow the progress in device_type_progress.json and module_type_progress.json. On top of each file.

Download the "code" as ZIP from https://github.com/netbox-community/devicetype-library and extract the folder (devicetype-library-master) inside the zip in the same folder than main.py


Should look like that:
